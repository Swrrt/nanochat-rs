Tiny GPT-style core reimplemented in pure Rust, tracking
[karpathy/nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat). Built on
[candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), focused on clarity and parity with
the reference while keeping the code minimal.


> [!WARNING]
> Experimental and focus on inference for now.


## Features
- Native rust
- Integration with HuggingFace
- Centralized model loader resilient to tensor name changes
- Minimal surface area to keep cognitive load low (not production-grade, performance-simplicity trade-off)
- Compatible with tiktoken `.pkl` tokenizer configs

### Main difference with the referenced nanochat
- Tokenizer encoding/decoding is production ready, so it is unified without dependency on tiktoken
- Removed the embeded python interpreter in engine
- Some performance and ergonomic improvement on the generation logic. 
- More emphasis on post training 


## Quick start
we have a 32 layer version trained with about $1000 budget at hugging face: https://huggingface.co/Antigma/nanochat-d32
there is also a smaller 20 layer version d20 used for benchmark and testing within the same HuggingFace repo

run on Apple With GPU
```
cargo run --release --features metal -- -p "write 100 words"
```

with Cuda
```
cargo run --release --features cuda -- -p "write 100 words"

```

We also provide a ChatGPT-like web UI. To launch it, run:

```
cargo run --bin chat_web
```

After starting the server, visit the URL displayed in the terminal (by default, [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), or use your host's public IP/port if running on a remote machine).

You can now interact with your local LLM just like ChatGPT—try asking creative questions, writing stories, or exploring model behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> The web UI assets (`ui.html`, `logo.svg`, etc.) live inside the `reference/nanochat` submodule. Make sure you initialize submodules before running `chat_web`:
> ```
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```
> The web server loads a model from Hugging Face by default (`hf:Antigma/nanochat-d32`). If you already have the weights locally, point the server to them with `--source /path/to/model_dir` to avoid unnecessary downloads.

Direct link: [demo1.mp4](./demo1.mp4)

Build:
```
cargo build --release
```

Run tests (validates parity against reference fixtures):
```
cargo test -q
```

Run benchmarks (Criterion):
```
cargo bench --features metal
```
This benchmark uses the d20 version of the model
Reports will be written under `target/criterion/**/report/index.html`.

## Upstream tracking and correctness
The reference implementation lives under `reference/nanochat` (tracked from
`karpathy/nanochat`). Parity is tested via auto-generated fixtures under
`fixtures/`. Numerical tolerance for logits parity is 1e-4.

If you cloned with submodules, you can update them with:
```
git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
```

### Regenerate fixtures
This uses the Python reference via `uv` and writes JSON fixtures into `fixtures/`.
```
./gen-fixtures.sh
```

Tokenizer tests expect a tiktoken pickle at `reference/tokenizer.pkl` (a small
one is provided in the repo).

## High level roadmap
- A webserver to match original python reference
- SFT and RL(requires backward pass)
- (maybe) bring back the embedded python interpreter (or other context free language like Lua) 
- Additional tensor backend other than Candle, encountered many candle kernel issues while building this.
- Pretraining (low priority, likely limited utility to do full training in Rust)
